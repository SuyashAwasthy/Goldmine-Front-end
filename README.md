# Goldmine-Front-end
This is the front-end implementation of Goldmine project which was earlier developed in C++ using dynamic programming. Here, I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript to implement this project using Dynamic Programming.

User inputs the Gold-weight at each cell of the grid so as to find the maximum gold that can be dug out while moving from left wall to the right wall.
We can only go to the following cells from the current cell:
1. (column+1, row-1)
2. (column+1, row)
3. (column+1, row+1)

On clicking the "Calculate" button, maximum gold weight is shown as the result. 
This project helped me to implement dynamic programming algorithm with front-end technology.
